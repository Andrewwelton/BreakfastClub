    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trick or Eat is a youth-led national event that puts a new spin on the annual night of giving â€“ Halloween!
      Thousands of Trick or Eaters across Canada, go door to door to collect food for local community organizations, and
      funds to support students advocating for good food for all. Trick or Eat is a national day of action, for young
      people to come together and actively show that they want to see a difference on the issue of hunger on their campuses
      and in their communities.
